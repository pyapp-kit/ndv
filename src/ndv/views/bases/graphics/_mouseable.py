    The signals here are to be emitted by the view object that inherits this class;
    usually by intercepting native mouse events with `filter_mouse_events`.

    The methods allow the object to handle its own mouse events before emitting the
    signals. If the method returns `True`, the event is considered handled and should
    not be passed to the next receiver in the chain.
