class ArrayDisplayModel(NDVModel):
    """Model of how to display an array.

    An `ArrayDisplayModel` is used to specify how to display a multi-dimensional array.
    It specifies which axes are visible, how to reduce along axes that are not visible,
    how to display channels, and how to apply lookup tables to channels.  It is
    typically paired with a [`ndv.DataWrapper`][] in order to resolve axis keys and
    slice data.

    !!! info

        In the following types, `Hashable` is used to refer to a type that will
        typically be either an integer index or a string label for an axis.

    Attributes
    ----------
    visible_axes : tuple[Hashable, ...]
        Ordered list of axes to visualize, from slowest to fastest.
        e.g. `('Z', -2, -1)`
    current_index : Mapping[Hashable, int | slice]
        The currently displayed position/slice along each dimension.
        e.g. {0: 0, 'time': slice(10, 20)}
        Not all axes need be present, and axes not present are assumed to
        be slice(None), meaning it is up to the controller of this model to restrict
        indices to an efficient range for retrieval.
        If the number of non-singleton axes is greater than `n_visible_axes`,
        then `reducers` are used to reduce the data along the remaining axes.
    reducers : Mapping[Hashable | None, numpy.ufunc]
        Function used to reduce data along axes remaining after slicing.
        Ideally, the ufunc should accept an `axis` argument.
        *(TODO: what happens if not?)*
    default_reducer : numpy.ufunc
        Default reducer to use when no reducer is specified for an axis. By default,
        this is [`numpy.max`][].
    channel_mode : ChannelMode
        How to display channel information:

        - `GRAYSCALE`: ignore channel axis, use `default_lut`
        - `COMPOSITE`: display all channels as a composite image, using `luts`
        - `COLOR`: display a single channel at a time, using `luts`
        - `RGBA`: display as an RGB image, using `default_lut` (except for cmap)

        If `channel_mode` is set to anything other than `GRAYSCALE`, then `channel_axis`
        must be set to a valid axis; if no `channel_axis` is set, at the time of
        display, the [`DataWrapper`][ndv.DataWrapper] MAY guess the `channel_axis`,
        and set it on the model.
    channel_axis : Hashable | None
        The dimension index or name of the channel dimension.
        The implication of setting channel_axis is that *all* elements along the channel
        dimension are shown, with different LUTs applied to each channel.
        If None, then a single lookup table is used for all channels (`luts[None]`).
        NOTE: it is an error for channel_axis to be in `visible_axes` (or ignore it?)
    luts : Mapping[int | None, LUTModel]
        Instructions for how to display each channel of the array.
        Keys represent position along the dimension specified by `channel_axis`.
        Values are `LUT` objects that specify how to display the channel.
        The special key `None` is used to represent a fallback LUT for all channels,
        and is used when `channel_axis` is None.  It should always be present
    default_lut : LUTModel
        Default lookup table to use when no `LUTModel` is specified for a channel in
        `luts`.
