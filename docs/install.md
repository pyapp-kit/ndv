# Installation

`ndv` can be used in a variety of contexts. It supports various **GUI
 frameworks**, including [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt),
 [PySide](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python), [wxPython](https://wxpython.org),
 and [Jupyter Lab & Notebooks](https://jupyter.org).  It also works with
 different **graphics libraries**, including [VisPy](https://vispy.org) (for
 OpenGL) and [Pygfx](https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx) (for WebGPU).

These frameworks are *not* included directly with `ndv` and must be installed
independently. We provide a set of installation extras depending on the graphics
and GUI libraries you want to use:
