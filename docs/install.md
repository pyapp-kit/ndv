# Installation

`ndv` brings provides a wrapper around multiple different graphics and GUI
frameworks, providing a performant multi-dimensional viewer that can be used in
a variety of contexts.  It work with multiple different graphics libraries,
including Vispy (for OpenGL) and Pygfx (for WebGPU).  It also supports various
GUI frameworks, including PyQt5, PySide2, wxPython, and Jupyter notebooks.

However, each of these libraries has its own dependencies and installation
requirements.  To make it easier to install `ndv`, we provide a set of
pre-configured installation extras based on the graphics and GUI libraries you
want to use:
